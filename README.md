## The Math

-Hamiltionian path & graph theory:
-cryptography: It has been used for cryptographic messages in the 1800s and later. Without the key, there are too many possibilities to consider and is impossible to read.

## The Submission

The knight's tour refers to a single knight, which is one of the pieces which is used to when playing chess. A knight's path is a sequence of moves by a knight such that each square of the board is visited exactly once.This relates to graphs, specifically the hamiltonian path. The hamiltionian path is defined as a path between two verticies of a graph that visit each individual vertex exactly once. We can imagine each square on the chessboard as a vertex that is visited only once. Euler called the knight's tour a "curious problem that does not submit to any kind of analysis." While examining the problem, Euler stated that there were not infinitely many solutions but rather too many to count.

## Additional Notes

 Two mathematicians made the first attempt to solve the problem with a computer but were incorrect. Another Mathematician who attempted stated that there were approximately 19 quadrillion non-looped tours but this has not been proven to be correct.

We intended on implementing multiple solutions, as well as a function so that the user can save the path image they created. This would personalize the experience, as each user would basically create a work of art that they should share. We also wanted to create a leaderboard of the top scores people were able to reach (if they reached 63 squares, all 64, etc.).

Along with this completed readme, this repository should contain **the single file** or files needed for your submission. For example, if this submission is a _Math Square_ behavior, only submit the JavaScript or TypeScript file containing the behavior, not the entire source of the exhibit.
